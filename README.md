In this project, I developed a predictive model to forecast the outcomes of NBA games for the Los Angeles Lakers (LAL) using a ExtraTreesClassifier. Key performance metrics and features such as points, shooting percentages, and assists were analyzed, and the model was tuned using GridSearchCV. The final model and imputer were saved for future predictions, ensuring robust performance through cross-validation and handling imbalanced data with SMOTE.
